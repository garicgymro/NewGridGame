Windows are the base class
Frames are windows
Panels are placed in a frame
Sizers are abstract base classes for laying out subwindows in a window -
sizers should be able to contain frames and panels?

Questions:
How does the server/client interact?

To implement:
Fix new DrawingPage

**Client**
GuiWindow(wx.Frame)
    Defines the welcome, survey, instruction, speaker_draw, listener_idle, speaker_idle, display_pic,
    listener_choice stages.
    Also swaps listener and speaker after receiving a begin_msg from the server after the end of each round?
    What is msg_panel?

    What do encode,submit msg do?
        submit_message() is called by OnSubmit(), which happens when submit is clicked.

    incoming_message(self, message) takes in messages from the server and uses regex to trigger if statements. This
    method is called by ??.
        instruction_stage()
        practice round
        proper round
        What is 610-653? re.match(self.speaker_buttons_msg, message)
        What is 679-683 m.group()? -> extracting info from the server message w/ regex.


QuestionnairePage(wx.Panel) (can be ignored)
WelcomePage(wx.Panel)
    Called by welcome_stage(self), which is called by incoming_message(self, message) to change stage to welcome.
ListenerButtonsPanel(wx.Panel)
    Called by listener_choice_stage(self), which is called by submit_message(self) to <<>>
    Images are sent to the server as a message via path.
    Speaker will see the grid + the image they submitted to the server.
SpeakerButtonsPanel(wx.Panel)
    Same as above, except the speaker is the one choosing the referent??
    There is no drawing grid.
    This class is called by speaker_buttons_stage() but is not in use?
DrawingPage(wx.Panel)
    Panel used for grid drawing. Timer included. Should also include a correct counter?
    Defines the clicking behavior for the grid. On click, colors in grid square.
    *Implement a method that displays the submitted grid upon submission*
MessagePanel(wx.Panel)
    Called by listener_idle_stage() and speaker_idle_stage() to display messages.
InstructionsPage(wx.Panel)
    Called by instructions_stage() and displays instructions.
Reader(threading.Thread)
    Reads in data from the server.
    Calls incoming_message() in run(self) method. Where is run(self) called?
class DummyPanel(wx.Panel) (can be ignored)
Client class creates app and initializes GuiWindow as a frame.


**run_client**
Not sure why this is needed

**TestGrid**
