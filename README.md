# GridGame
Project by Inthat Boonpongmanee, and Sophie Faircloth, and Gareth Roberts Software by Inthat Boonpongmanee and Gareth Roberts based on earlier software by Gareth Roberts, Lisa Raithel and Jon Stevens
A communicative game in which players take turns (typically) to communicate meanings by selecting cells in a 12x12 grid. In some conditions there is noise. After a certain point a sent message may be replaced by an earlier more complex message. Question: Will participants notice? How will they respond?
