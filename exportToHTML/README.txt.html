<pre><span class="s0">Important client classes:</span>

<span class="s0">SpeakerButtonsPanel (instantiated by speaker_buttons_stage()):</span>
<span class="s0">-Where the Sender selects the picture he/she wants to draw.</span>
<span class="s0">-THIS IS NOT BEING USED IN THE CURRENT VERSION</span>

<span class="s0">DrawingPage (instantiated by speaker_draw_stage()):</span>
<span class="s0">-Where the Sender makes his/her grid drawing.</span>

<span class="s0">ListenerButtonsPanel (instantiated by listener_choice_stage()):</span>
<span class="s0">-Where the Receiver sees the grid drawing makes his/her guess</span>


<span class="s0">Notes:</span>

<span class="s0">-&quot;Hard mode&quot; means when the timer runs out, a blank grid is sent, forcing 50/50 chance of failure.  When turned off, a partially filled grid can be sent.</span>

<span class="s0">-To get human readable grid drawings, run the &quot;texify.py&quot; script from the command line with the name of the results file as its only argument.  This will create a folder with the same name as the results file containing a .tex file.  Compile the .tex file to get a PDF with glance-able drawings for each round.</span>

<span class="s0">-There is still some de-crufting to be done.</span></pre>
