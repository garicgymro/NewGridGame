<pre><span class="s0">You live in a galaxy far far away. Along with your partner, located on a separate planet, you are responsible for coordinating traffic through your solar system. Part of this work involves making sure that the correct route-maps are provided to cargo-ships. Unfortunately, there has been a system failure! Some of your route-maps have got confused with each other. Luckily, your partner have the information to put you right. But your communication system is also failing and you don’t have much time. You will have to communicate quickly to each other to help choose the correct route maps.</span>

<span class="s0">This game consists of a series of rounds, in each of which you will take the role of receiver while your partner will take the role of sender.</span>

<span class="s0">At the start of a round your partner the sender will see two route-maps, each of which looks like a line figure drawn over a grid of squares. One of them (the correct map) will be highlighted in green. Next to these two maps will be an empty grid. The sender’s job is to communicate to you which of the two maps is highlighted by filling in squares in the empty grid. It’s up to the sender which squares to fill and how many, but there are two important things they must keep in mind:</span>

<span class="s0">1. The system failure has left you with a very limited communication channel. To fill in a square of the grid means clicking on it %s times. THE SENDER MUST CLICK ON IT ENOUGH TIMES TO FILL IT. There is no such thing as partially filling a  grid-square.</span>

<span class="s0">2. You have limited time. From the moment the sender clicks inside a square of the grid, they will have only %s seconds before their turn is up. ONCE THE TIME IS UP NO MORE SQUARES CAN BE FILLED. The message has to be sent in time, or spacecraft will collide. </span>

<span class="s0">Once the sender’s turn is over, you will be presented with the sender’s completed grid along with the same two maps (though not necessarily in the same order). Your task as receiver is to choose which of the two maps your partner was trying to convey. </span>

<span class="s0">If you choose correctly, you both score one point. Then a new round will start.</span>

<span class="s0">At the end of the game, if you were successful on at least 80 percent of rounds, you will win a prize in recognition of your good work under trying circumstances. If you score below 80 percent, you’ll lose your prestigious jobs and have to go back to cleaning cargo-holds.</span>

<span class="s0">Please make sure that you’ve read all instructions carefully before proceeding. Let the researcher know if you have any questions.</span>
